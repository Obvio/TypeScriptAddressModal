Hi!

A few of simple steps are required to use the app since the built version is also included.
1. `cd` into the root directory.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. After installation is complete, run `gulp serve`.

-------------------------------------
If you want to actually build it just run `gulp build`.

-------------------------------------
If you want to launch it in 'development mode' (with refreshes etc.) just run `gulp`.

-------------------------------------
A bit about my solution:
It was built using TypeScript and ES6 and all communication between components is done via CustomEvent(s).

When you review the code you'll some comments marked as //@MESSAGE - those are there to explain
the use in a real life scenario when there's a server that responds and other issues when integrated into the app.
